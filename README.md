## Announcements

* Lecture 1: [Introduction](documents/notes/01_introduction.md) and [Functional Primer](documents/notes/02_functional-primer.md).

* Regarding the reading and video-watching assignments, they are light on theory and more on practice.  Note that the reading assignments are required. In otherwords, you will be asked about them on the quiz.

  * Quiz tip 1: Understand the basic tenets of a BOT architecture.

  * Quiz tip 2: Practice code found in chapter 3 of [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/).

* A number of students have asked if they can attend a different session than the one that they are assigned to attend.  My short answer is: it should be fine.  However, please keep in mind that once you attend a different session, you need to stick to that session.  This is because of the varying class dynamics and pace.

* Please review the [course syllabus](Syllabus.md) and come to class with questions.  In order for us to be prepared for the first day of class, please bring your laptop computer.  We will have a short non-graded assessment quiz.  The purpose of the quiz is to gauge the the students' programming level.
