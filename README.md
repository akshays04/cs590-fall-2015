## Announcements

* Lecture 1: [Introduction](documents/notes/01_introduction.md) and [Functional Primer](documents/notes/02_functional-primer.md).

  * There are a few reading (and video watching) assignments.  They are light on theory and more on practice sprinkled with the discussion of a novel software architecture called BOT.

* A number of students have asked if they can attend a different session than the one that they are assigned to attend.  My short answer is: it should be fine.  However, please keep in mind that once you attend a different session, you need to stick to that session.  This is because of the varying class dynamics and pace.

* Please review the [course syllabus](Syllabus.md) and come to class with questions.  In order for us to be prepared for the first day of class, please bring your laptop computer.  We will have a short non-graded assessment quiz.  The purpose of the quiz is to gauge the the students' programming level.
