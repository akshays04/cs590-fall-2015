# Homework 1

Using the example that we have done in class, you will modify the gradesheet application and add registration feature.

## Requirement Definition

Your task is to provide these two features:

* Registration of a new user (username and/or email and password)
* Once the user is registered you will demonstrate a login page that authenticates against the credential established above.

## Deliverable

You will demonstrate the homework assignment in class during the assigned time.  You will only need to demonstrate the homework assignment to the instructor.

## Discussion

Please be prepared to answer the following questions during the demonstration:

1. Tradeoff Analysis -- did you consider any tradeoffs decisions?  If so what are they?  If not, why not?
2. Risk Analysis -- did you assess any risk based on the decision that you've made.  These decisions can include features, coding model, etc.
