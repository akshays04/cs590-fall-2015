# Lecture 1: Functional Primer

## Objectives

1. Introduction to Functional Programming and Lambda Calculus
2. Practice some examples of FP

## Metrics/Desired Outcomes

* Write a simple `hello-world.clj` from scratch

## Reading Assignment

## Lambda Calculus

Pure functions have two requirements:
* `referential transparency` -- always return the same result if provided same arguments
* No side effects

Other intangible aspects of Functional Programming:
* Functions are first class citizens; treatment of functions (shifting our way of thinking) are same (if not more important than data)
* Emphasis on algorithm of data structure
* Small and decomposable functions (tasks or actions)
