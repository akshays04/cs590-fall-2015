# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Objectives

1. Course logistics
2. Course schedule
3. Development environment

## Metrics/Desired Outcomes

* Github
* Homework submission process
* In class quiz (not graded)

## Reading Assignment

* Higginbotham, Daniel. Chapter 3 from [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/). A free PDF version (of Chapter 3) is available from No Starch Press.

## Development Environment

We will use clojure as development language for the course.  You are free to use the development environment/IDE of your choice.  I recommends one of the following tools:

* [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the _de facto_ editor for clojure developers.  It has many plugins and customizations that makes this the best option.  Note there is somewhat of a steep learning curve. However, the payoff is huge.
* [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) is an up and coming IDE that is very suitable for the REPL programming model.
* [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) is the _de facto_ build tool for clojure.  There is simply nothing better out there.  It heavily leverages `maven` and in some sense, one can make an argument that `leiningen` is `maven` done right.

In addition to the above tools, we will discover and utilize new tools and libraries as the course progresses forward.

We will utilize github heavily for this course.  Please familiarize yourself with github.  In particular, understand key git terminologies, e.g. push, pull, commit, etc.
