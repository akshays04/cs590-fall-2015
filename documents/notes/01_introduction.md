## Reading Assignment

* Misophistful's [Introduction to Light Table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f13TTu_X9k).  This is an excellent 1/2 hr video on Light Table and it incorporates clojure and clojurescript development. About 4:40 into the video the narrator talks about the BOT architecture; pay especial attention to this architecture.

* Granger, Chris. [The IDE as a value](http://www.chris-granger.com/2013/01/24/the-ide-as-data/).  This blog discusses the BOT architecture.

## Development Environment

We will use clojure as development language for the course.  You are free to use the development environment/IDE of your choice.  I recommends one of the following tools:

* [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/) is an up and coming IDE that is very suitable for the REPL programming model.
* [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the _de facto_ editor for clojure developers.  It has many plugins and customizations that makes this the best option.  Note there is somewhat of a steep learning curve. However, the payoff is huge.
* [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) is the _de facto_ build tool for clojure.  There is simply nothing better out there.  It heavily leverages `maven` and in some sense, one can make an argument that `leiningen` is `maven` done right.

In addition to the above tools, we will discover and utilize new tools and libraries as the course progresses forward.

We will utilize github heavily for this course.  Please familiarize yourself with github.  In particular, understand key git terminologies, e.g. push, pull, commit, etc.
