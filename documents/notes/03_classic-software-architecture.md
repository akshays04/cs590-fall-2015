# Lecture 2: Classic Software Architecture

## Objectives

* Understand functional programming collection, recursion, and modules
* Understand classic software archiecture curriculum

## Metrics/Desired Outcomes

* Comprehension of collections in clojure 
* Write recursive functions with clojure
* Comprehension of the keypoints of classical software architecture

## Reading Assignment

* Fairbanks, George. [Introduction to Software Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x30DcBfCJRI).  We will watch and discuss this video in class.

## Introduction to Clojure Videos (continued)

1. Collections (7:02)
2. Recursions (8:16)
3. Modules (3:44)

## Classic Software Architecture Curriculum

### Introduction to Software Architecture  (0:00 - 29:22)
* Introduction video segment (0:00 - 29:22)
* Provided some motivations as to why software architecture is important
* Tradeoffs
* Many architectures yield different choices
* Case Study of Rackspace three design models

### Part 1 (29:22 - 54:42)
* Differences between architecture, architecting, and architect
* Views: consitent or inconsistent views; limited view on components; view are specific to task/goal
* Non-functional requirement: quality attributes; dimension of quality to measure software (latency, security, ...)
* Design Space: range and constraints to make a decision
* Tradeoffs: not everything can be addressed or met
* Architecture Drivers: quality measure of how the system is to perform; helps identify and select architecture choice

### Part 2 (57:00)
* Rational Architecture Decisions: "X is a priority so we design Y accepting downside Z"

### Part 3
