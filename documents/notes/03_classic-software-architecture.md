# Lecture 2: Classic Software Architecture

## Objectives

* Understand functional programming collection, recursion, and modules
* Understand classic software archiecture curriculum

## Metrics/Desired Outcomes

* Comprehension of collections in clojure 
* Write recursive functions with clojure
* Comprehension of the keypoints of classical software architecture

## Reading Assignment

* Fairbanks, George. [Introduction to Software Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x30DcBfCJRI).  We will watch and discuss this video in class.

## Introduction to Clojure Videos (continued)

1. Collections (7:02)
2. Recursions (8:16)
3. Modules (3:44)

## Classic Software Architecture Curriculum

### Introduction to Software Architecture 
* Introduction video segment (0:00 - 29:22)
* Provided some motivations as to why software architecture is important
* Tradeoffs
* Many architectures yield different choices
* Case Study of Rackspace three design models

### Main Portion of the lecture
* Main lecture is (29:23 - end)
* Differences between architecture, architecting, and architect
* Views: consitent or inconsistent views; limited view on a system's component; view are specific to task/goal
* Non-functional requirement: quality attributes; dimension of quality to measure software (latency, security, ...)
