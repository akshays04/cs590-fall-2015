# Advanced Software Architecture

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of the course is to introduce students to the concepts and patterns of software architecture.  We _will_ implement a complex software system that requires sound architectural design decisions.
- **Expectation** The class will include lectures on topics relating to software architecture and on supplemental paper reading assignments.  Programming assignments will augment the theoretical aspects of software architecture.  Please understand that this is a graduate-level and upper-division engineering course.  As such, students are expected to devote a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.

## Logistics

- **Instructor** John J. Tran
- **Lecture** Monday 6:10 - 10:10 PM 
- **Office Hours** Monday 10-11 PM, Friday 10-11 PM, Saturday 10-11 PM

## Grading Allocation

1. Quizz (8) - 40 points
2. Homework (4) - 40 points
3. Project - 20 points

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project: a complete software system. Students will engage in a team or individual projects to leverage the opensource projects to facilitate their project development. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**
